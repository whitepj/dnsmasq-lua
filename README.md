# dnsmasq-lua
dnsmasq monitoring using lua.

Currently, this script is simply a boilerplate example of how we might want to
use the lua script option within dnsmasq to collect and store information
suitable for separate analysis. Created mainly because I couldn't find much 
documentation elsewhere.
